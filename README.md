# Sorting-Analysis
Created by Sidharth Lakshmanan

Goal: 
      This projects sole purpose is to provide data on the sorting prowess of 4 different types of array
      sorters: Merge Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, Bubble Sort. The tests each sorter will go through
      include arrays with sizes ranging 2 through 4096 with various initial sortings (random, sorted, and backwards).
      
Results:
      In terms of these sorting methods, in industry, merge sort is the fastest and most efficent way to sort. 
      However, it should be noted that in cases where the array is known to be already close to being sorted, 
      bubble sort may be the way to go. This is because very few swaps will be needed. And, in cases when the 
      processing power is limited, merge sort will not be the way to go as merge sort takes a lot of computing 
      resources as it has to manage a large call stack. But, overall, merge sort is the more efficient way to sort 
      an array.
